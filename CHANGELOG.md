* Fixed a bug in the Quest widget that prevented Quest indicators from being displayed in localizations where quest progress was shown to the left of the quest objective (e.g. in English) [Comment ##7657].
* Updated integrated library LibDualSpec to v1.27.0 to fix a Lua error that occurred when hovering over the dual spec options in the 'Profile' tab of the options.
