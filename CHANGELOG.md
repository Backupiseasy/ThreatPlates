# @project-version@ (@build-time@)

* Fixed a bug that occurred when the target transparency for a nameplate was greater than 100% or less than 0% as the Dragonflight API is more strict with valid transparency values [Issue #571, Comment #6532, #6536].
* Fixed a bug that occurred when a Rogue has seven combo points (after picking talents Deeper Stratagem and Devious Stratagem) [Comment #6529].
