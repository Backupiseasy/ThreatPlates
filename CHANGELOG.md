* Aura for Polymorph (Duck, Mage), and Polymorph (Mawrat, Mage) are now correctly recognized as crowd-control auras [GH-499].
* Fixed a bug with abbreviation for unit names now for all localizations where initials where shown as empty squares when UTF-8 fonts were used.
* Fixed a bug with tank role detection for Rogues - a wrong spell ID for Just a Flesh Wound was used [Comment #7166].
* Removed LibClassicDurations as aura durations are provided by the WoW API since WoW Classic Patch 1.15.0 [GH-430].
