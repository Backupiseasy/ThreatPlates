# LibThreatClassic2

Successor project for [https://github.com/EsreverWoW/LibThreatClassic](https://github.com/EsreverWoW/LibThreatClassic)

The latest version of this library will always be available through the addon [ThreatClassic2](https://github.com/dfherr/ThreatClassic2)

## How to use

To provide Threat data to other players just include and load the lib as part of your addon.

To start using the lib to display threat data get the latest revision from LibStub and get the UnitThreatSituation:

```
local ThreatLib = LibStub:GetLibrary("LibThreatClassic2")

local _UnitThreatSituation = function (unit, mob)
    return ThreatLib:UnitThreatSituation (unit, mob)
end

local _UnitDetailedThreatSituation = function (unit, mob)
    return ThreatLib:UnitDetailedThreatSituation (unit, mob)
end
```
