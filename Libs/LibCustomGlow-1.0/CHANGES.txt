    Fix double release warning
    
    A user on https://github.com/WeakAuras/WeakAuras2/issues/5834 reported
    an error "Attempted to release inactive object", which apparently
    happened due to:
    1) A call to ButtonGlow_Stop, which due to the parent being visible
       starts the animOut animation
    2) Before the animOut animation finishes, a second call to
       ButtonGlow_Stop finds the parent hidden, so it immediately releases
       the glow
    3) The glow is hidden, calling bgHide, which due to the animOut running
       released the glow
    
    This prevents the second ButtonGlow_Stop call from releasing the glow if
    the animation is running.
